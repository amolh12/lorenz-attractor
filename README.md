#Lyapunov Spectrum for Lorenz/Rossler Attractor

The method and the theory for the calculation of the complete lyapunov exponent is presented on this link http://www.math.tamu.edu/~mpilant/math614/Matlab/Lyapunov/LorenzSpectrum.pdf . (By Texas A & M University)

I have recently developed a C++ standalone code which can calculate the complete Lyapunov spectrum for Lorenz and Rossler attractor.
